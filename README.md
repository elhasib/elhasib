# ⚡ ELHASIB
### Democratizing Computer Engineering Education Across Africa

> **el-hasib** (الحاسب) — Arabic for "the computer"  
> Building open-source tools at the intersection of classical, optical, and quantum computing so that access to computer engineering education doesn't depend on where you were born or how much money your university has.

## 🌍 **The Problem**

Most computer engineering education assumes you have access to expensive software licenses, high-end hardware, and stable internet. If you're learning in Cairo, Nairobi, or Lagos? Good luck. Commercial tools cost thousands of dollars. Textbooks are paywalled. Tutorials assume you're at MIT.

Meanwhile, Africa contributes less than 1% to global computing research—not because we lack talent, but because we lack access to the tools that make advanced learning possible.

This is broken. We're fixing it.

## 🛠️ **What We Build**

ELHASIB creates open-source educational tools that run on low-end hardware, work offline, and teach foundational computer engineering concepts—from transistors to quantum circuits.

### **Current Tools:**

#### 🔌 **8-Bit CPU Simulator**
Complete walkthrough of building a functional CPU from scratch in Logisim. Learn von Neumann architecture, instruction sets, and how computers *actually* work under the hood. No CS degree required.

**Why it matters:** Most students never see how a CPU functions at the logic gate level. This demystifies it.

#### 💡 **MachDesigner: Photonic Circuit Simulator**
GUI-based tool for designing and simulating Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZI) with noisy analysis using Monte Carlo methods. Built in Python with Matplotlib.

**Why it matters:** Photonic computing is the future, but most educational tools are locked behind expensive licenses. This makes optical circuit design accessible to anyone with Python installed.

#### ⚛️ **Quantum Circuit Tutorials**
Step-by-step guides for building quantum algorithms (Grover's search, Deutsch-Jozsa, etc.) using IBM's Qiskit. Includes worked examples, explanations of quantum gates, and performance analysis.

**Why it matters:** Quantum computing education assumes you already know quantum mechanics. We start from "what even is a qubit?"

#### 🧮 **FEM Stress Analyzer**
Open-source 2D Finite Element Method (FEM) software for stress analysis using plane strain approximation. Visualizes stress distribution with Von Mises approximation.

**Why it matters:** Commercial FEM software (ANSYS, COMSOL) costs tens of thousands of dollars. This does the fundamentals for free.

#### 📚 **Computational Physics Problem Sets**
Curated collection of physics problems with full solutions—numerical methods, simulations, modeling. From pendulum dynamics to waveguide stress analysis.

**Why it matters:** Learning computational physics requires *doing* computational physics. These are the problem sets I wish I had when I started.

## 📊 **Impact So Far**

- **2,000+ GitHub repository views** across projects
- **Open-source contributions** from students in 12+ countries
- **Used by students** at universities in Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria
- **Zero cost** to access any resource (and it'll stay that way)

## 🎯 **Our Mission**

**Decolonize computer systems education.**

For too long, cutting-edge computing knowledge has been concentrated in institutions that most of the world can't access. We're changing that by:

1. **Building tools that work offline** (because internet access is a privilege)
2. **Requiring zero licensing fees** (because education shouldn't be paywalled)
3. **Teaching foundational concepts** (not just surface-level tutorials)
4. **Making everything open-source** (so anyone can fork, modify, and improve)

If you're in Accra or Alexandria and want to learn quantum computing, you shouldn't need a Stanford library card. You should need curiosity and an internet connection long enough to download our tutorials.

That's the world we're building.
